To facilitate the process of setting up an organization for the data, an example is provided containing artificial EEG data ([data/256](https://github.com/Svanteberg/Virtual-EEG-electrodes/tree/master/Artificial_EEG_for_testing_scripts/data/256)). The set contain EEG from 10 subjects with 1 - 3 recordings per subject, each recording consisting of 5 x 10 s of data. The subject id:s are in the file `subjects_folders` and the index list is in `indices.npy`. This small dataset is for illustration purpose only — more data will have to be generated to train networks.

The script `art_eeg.py` can be used to generate more data. The data is simple, consisting of multiple sources with spatial distributions, including occasional muscle and blink artifacts, which are added together (linearly). The basic cortical signal is generated by amlitude modulating a sinus wave with a Markov process (adapted from: Bai et al., ”Nonlinear Markov process amplitude EEG model for nonlinear coupling interaction of spontaneous EEG,” IEEE Transactions of biomedicine engineering, vol. 47, nr 9, pp. 1141 – 1146, 2000).

The resulting data can be more or less realistic, but with a tendency to be monomorphic and rhythmic activity often having a relatively general distribution. It will have a simple statistic, is more well-behaved compared to most real data, and is easier to train a generative network with (but probably will not generalize well to real data).

The file `plot_original_eeg.py` is a tkinter based simple GUI that can be used to visualize the data (or any EEG saved in the same manner, i.e., size (21, 2560) and named: eeg_0.npy, eeg_1.npy, ...)
